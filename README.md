# UCF Project 1
This project is the summation of the interactive front end development section of the University of Central Florida Full Stack Developer Bootcamp.

## Project Description
This application provides a weekly menu planner.  A user can search for recipes, and when they select one, it is placed on a card with a thumbnail picture and a link to the recipe.  The card is initially placed in a landing zone and can be dragged and dropped to the desired day of the week.  When a card is clicked on, the user can visit the recipe link, edit the title, or add the ingredients to a shopping list. The shopping list appears on a second page and can be edited item by item. Items can also be added via form on the shopping list page. The menu plan and shopping list are saved to local storage.  The BigOven API is used to power the recipe search and ingredient list.

On the shopping list page, there is also a form entry for a zip code labeled "find grocery stores near me." Upon entering a zip code and searching, a map is shown with the closest grocery stores. The Google find places API powers this search. 

The Materialize CSS framework is used for styling.
